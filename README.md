# Java File Operations Demo

## Overview

This is a simple Java console application that demonstrates basic file handling operations.  
It shows how to create, read, append, and modify text files using Java’s java.io package.  

The project is intended for beginners who want to understand file handling in Java and see it in action through a straightforward example.

## Features
